                <p class="hero_description"><strong>Hi.</strong> A little bit about me: 4 years ago I was a kid playing video games with no idea what to do with his life at all. I eventually got to discover startups and the world of business. I pursued corporate business first, thinking that was the way to go for my first 2 years of college. Fast forward to now, in my third year of college and I'm <strong>taking a semester off</strong> to work full-time on Percuri in the middle of learning programming and embracing the genAI wave to the fullest. I want you, the world, to know that this change is not easy. But easy is not fun, is it? Anyways, what is this page about? I like to create stuff all the time. Whether it's a new song, video, or business I'm always pushing the bounds of what I know is possible. Truth is, this is a massive transformation I'm undertaking that you get to see in real time. So, I'm leaving it all here: the professional work, creative work, and everything I think about in between. Feel free to click around the links and engage on any of my platforms. Click the button here to send me a message, I'm always looking to meet new people. <em><strong>Let's get this!</strong></em></p>

        <h3><em>What startup is he working on full-time?!</em></h3>
          <p> My current project taking up 75% of my time is Percuri, an automated intern management tool. I noticed that lots of internship experiences can be disorganized and messy, leading to unsatisfying outcomes. As an intern, you want to get a return offer and as a manager, you want to have the latest up-to-date info on your best interns. Essentially, just "winging it" is not the ideal way to go through an internship, so we give interns a place for all their information from training and learning to be in the same place. Our AI assistant is perfect for helping a new intern adjust to a company and succeed. You can click on the button to take you to the landing page to get more information. Even if you're not looking for internships, I would love any feedback you have on the concept.</p>
